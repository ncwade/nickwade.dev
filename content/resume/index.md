My goal at any company is finding technical solutions to business problems. I have an affinity for CICD, automation, and general SRE work. I love learning new technologies, meeting new people, and finding out why I’m wrong. I’ve got experience working with everything from embedded Linux systems to Kubernetes clusters.
