I enjoy finding technical solutions to business problems. I have an affinity for CICD, infrastructure, and security work. I love learning new technologies, meeting new people, and finding out why I am wrong. I have eleven years of experience in everything from kernel modules on embedded Linux systems to doing security scanning for cloud based infrastructure. Current working on the Digital Crimes Unit at GoDaddy building and maintaining the abuse report pipeline.
